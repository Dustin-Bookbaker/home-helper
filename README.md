# homehelper

## A Flutter App using Firebase

This App uses Firebase and Bloc (and a lot of ~~stolen~~ inspired stuff :sunglasses:)

### Background

This Project was written in about one week as an application for a scholarship regarding Covid.
During the onset of the Pandemic, a lot of people that were propably not as tech-savvy were suddenly told to do home office.

The idea was to provide a mobile solution to create a platform for people looking for help and people wanting to help.
You can create a ticket describing your problem and someone can take that ticket, which will enable a messenger-like chat between these people.

The ticket author and the helper can choose to free up the ticket anytime.

All in all, this project was great practice and I learned a lot from it.
If anyone finds something useful in here, feel free to salvage away :sunglasses:
